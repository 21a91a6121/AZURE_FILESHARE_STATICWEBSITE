# AZURE_FILESHARE_STATICWEBSITE

Project Title: Azure FileShare and Static Website 

FILE SHARE:
Introduction:
This project harnesses Azure technology to establish a robust file-sharing system among three Linux virtual machines via the Azure portal. We began by creating a storage account, followed by setting up a file share within it. After that, we sequentially deployed three Linux virtual machines, ensuring access to the shared file storage.

Configuration and Script Deployment:
Our journey began by creating an Azure storage account, serving as the central hub for our shared files. Within this storage account, we configured a file share, granting access to our Linux virtual machines. Subsequently, we launched each virtual machine and introduced a script from the shared file share. This script streamlined the copying of files to each VM.

Real-Time Collaboration:
A highlight of this project was the seamless real-time collaboration it enabled. Any file added or modified in one virtual machine was instantaneously replicated across all three VMs. This allowed for efficient teamwork and data sharing, eliminating the need for manual file transfers.

Scalability and Reliability:
Our solution offered scalability, efficiently accommodating growing data requirements and multiple users. Leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure, we ensured the reliability and availability of our shared files, which is essential for any collaborative project.

User-Friendly and Efficient:
This Azure-based file-sharing system was designed for user-friendliness. It offers an intuitive and efficient means of collaboration and data sharing among Linux virtual machines. The centralized management and automatic synchronization enhance productivity and teamwork.

Conclusion:
In summary, our project effectively showcased the potential of Azure technology for creating a streamlined and reliable file-sharing ecosystem among Linux virtual machines. The ability to instantaneously share and synchronize files across VMs underscores the practicality of Azure services in enhancing collaborative projects, while the scalability and reliability ensure a robust foundation for future growth and success.
      
STATIC WEBSITE:

Title: Azure Static Website Deployment

Introduction:
This project demonstrates the creation of a static website using Azure technology, specifically through the Azure Portal. By establishing a structured process, we created a secure and publicly accessible website. This project offers an easy-to-follow guide for deploying static websites, providing a valuable resource for various web projects.

Creating a Storage Account and Website:
Our journey commenced with the creation of an Azure storage account, which forms the core of our static website deployment. Navigating to the static website section within the storage account settings allowed us to initiate the creation of our website. This process involved the creation of an "index.html" file, automatically generating a "$web" folder to store our website's content.

Uploading Website Content:
To make our website accessible to the world, we uploaded all the necessary website files into the "$web" folder. This straightforward task ensured that our website's content was readily available for viewing.

Setting Access Permissions:
An essential aspect of our project was determining who could access our website. By adjusting the access level to "public" within the storage account settings, we opened our website to everyone. With this change, we acquired a direct link to our website, facilitating easy and open access.

Website Verification:
With the public access link in hand, we verified the functionality and accessibility of our website. Pasting the link into a web browser allowed us to instantly check and validate that our website was working as intended, making it accessible to a global audience.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project showcases the simplicity and efficiency of deploying a static website using Azure technology. The step-by-step guide offers an easy approach to website hosting while ensuring access control. This project underlines the user-friendliness and practicality of Azure services, making it a valuable resource for a wide range of web projects.
